                            <h3>What is Life Insurance</h3>
                            <p>Life insurance is simple. You make reoccurring payments (your premium), and we pay a set amount of money, tax-free, to whoever you choose (your beneficiaries),
                            including your favorite charities if you want, when you pass away.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="column" >
                            <h3>Why do I need a life insurance policy?</h3>
                            <p>Life insurance helps cover expenses like a mortgage, debts, your kids’ tuition, even replacing lost income when you’re no longer here. Depending on the type you get, it can be the foundation for a sound
                                financial plan and help with expenses during your life.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="column" >
                            <h3>Is life insurance affordable?</h3>
                            <p>Surprisingly so, but there are a lot of options to choose from so the cost will vary, too. What you pay monthly (or yearly) will depend on things like the type and amount of life insurance 
                                that will fit your needs, as well as your age and health.</p>

                            <h3>Isn't life insurance through my work enough?</h3>
                            <p>Life insurance offered through your employer usually 
                                won't give you the coverage amount you may need, and the rates 
                                may go up year after year costing you more over time. Plus, if 
                                you ever leave your job, you can't take your coverage with you.</p>

                                uses the power of data to speed up decisions and eliminate the need

                            <p>Yes, two ways: dividends (while not guaranteed, we’ve paid them every 
                                year since 1872) can be taken as cash, used to pay premiums, or buy
                                more coverage. Some policies like whole life insurance also build cash 
                                value over time that you can use for anything throughout your life.</p>
